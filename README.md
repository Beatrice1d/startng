So, this is becoming more fun by the day.
This week, I have had a lot of workload to contend with and juggling STARTNG alongside has been a task in itself.
Today, is the deadline for Task 2 so I am trying to make sure I submit.
Biko, I can not be yanked off o
Not to digress but, Umunnem let us take a moment to appreciate the sponsors of this learning program.

Ehen, so as I was saying...
That's how I switched on generator some minutes before 10pm yesterday (August 22nd, 2019)

Hey Coding, we are in this together!

TASK 3

HINT: OPEN the file titled TASK 3 on this repository - that's how beautiful CSS can be!
Hello Everyone,
So, it's me again.
This should be a link to my lucid post saying how much the CSS addition has improved the initial HTML.
However, the LUCID BLOG IS DOWN so I'd just post this here.
The CSS literall brought life to the HTML. I love it!
Wow! Lots of new things one can play around with.
For this project (because it's a CV and really a CV can only do with so much designs anyway), I adjusted picture height, image border radius, played around with colours for my headers and some background colours too. Tried to use the class method too.
Cool stuff I'm learning - Realy cool stuff!
